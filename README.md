# pdf_certificates_usign_python3
Generate PDF certifcates using python3. The program will read a csv file (which for the sake of this example 
is hard coded in, but you can make it an argument and pass it on).
Please create environment for python before executing the main.py file.

-->First Type in the terminal(MacOS/Linux) 
python3 -m venv venv
-->Then activate the Virtual environment.
. venv/bin/activate
Also download Reportlab, as it is used for creating and 
styling the pdf files.
